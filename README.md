# pyqrse

Python 3 package for estimating Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium Models

**Note: pyqrse is the early alpha stage of development and subject to change. This site is here a basic markup on the intended structure**


## Documentation

[Documentation](https://pyqrse.readthedocs.io) is under construction. However, the search of functionality and module index are up and running.

## Examples

The [example](https://github.com/econokeith/pyqrse/blob/master/example/) folder has the following jupyter notebook examples:

* [Basic Example](https://github.com/econokeith/pyqrse/blob/master/example/pyqrse_sample.ipynb)
* [QRSE on Skewed Data](https://github.com/econokeith/pyqrse/blob/master/example/pyqrse_sample_skewed_data.ipynb)

## Requirements

We suggest downloading and using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) Python 3 Distribution, which includes most
of the important python scientific computing packages.

**pyqrse** requires the following standard members of the python scientific computing suite that are included in the Anaconda distribution:
* [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html): computational engine for scientific computing in python
* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/): advanced math and statistics functionality
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): plotting functionality
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): additional plotting for statistics applications
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): R-like data structures and data analysis tools
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/): open source version of Mathematica Notebook


**pyqrse** requires the following package that is not included in the standard Acaconda distribution:
* [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd)

## Installation

1. Download and install the Anaconda Python 3 Installation.
2. Install Autograd in the command line using the conda installer:

    `$conda install autograd`

3. Clone the **pyqrse** directory by clicking on the green button on the upper right side of this webpage or by entering into the command line:
